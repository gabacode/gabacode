<h1 align="left">Hello!</h1>

<h3 align="left">My name is Gabriele Scalici, and I love technology for the ways it can improve lives on this planet, and beyond.
<br/><br />
I been attracted to web development since my childhood. I used to play making websites at the age of 8 with the mighty Netscape Composer.
<br/><br />
Some time has passed since then, I have since surfed the web, and got acquaintanced with HTML and PHP, as I developed my firsts PHP-Nuke portals, then Xoops, then Joomla etc...
<br/><br />
As WordPress continued booming, I developed interests for frameworks such as Laravel, React, and Next-Js. The interaction between all these platforms helps me creating performing and flexible web platforms, that are easy to deploy, and easy to use for every-day users.
<br/><br />
I love cycling, meditating, creating art, and making new thingys with Arduino, 3D printers and laser cutters.
